## Dataset
The dataset used for font classification consists of a collection of text images in corresponding folders indicating the font family or typeface. Each image in the dataset represents a sample of text written in a specific font.<br>
**There are total 10 font classes present in the dataset with approximate 80 sample images per font.**
The data is present at [project_files/data](https://github.com/mishra-kunal1/font_classification/tree/main/project_files/data) of the repo.
The folder structure looks like this
